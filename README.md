GoAltdns is a permutation generation tool that can take a list of subdomains, permute them using a wordlist, insert indexes, numbers, dashes and increase your chance of finding that estoeric subdomain that no-one found during bug-bounty or pentest. It uses a number of techniques to accomplish this. It can allow for discovery of subdomains that conform to patterns. GoAltdns takes in words that could be present in subdomains under a domain (such as test, dev, staging) as well as takes in a list of subdomains that you know of.

The tool itself is very simple and is built with golang concurrency providing it very quick execution times. 

# Installation Instructions

The installation is easy. Just `go get` the repo.

```bash
go get github.com/subfinder/goaltdns
```

Note - You need to copy the words.txt file into the same directory as the tool or specify it's location via the -w flag.

## Upgrading
If you wish to upgrade the package you can use:

```bash
go get -u github.com/subfinder/goaltdns
```

# Usage

GoAltdns can either take a single host as argument or a list of hosts. To provide a single host, you can use the `-host` option. In order to provide a list of hosts, you can use the `-l` option.

Sample run:

```bash
ice3man@TheDaemon:~/tmp/altdns$ ./altdns -host phabricator.freelancer.com
1phabricator.freelancer.com
phabricator1.freelancer.com
10phabricator.freelancer.com
1-phabricator.freelancer.com
phabricator10.freelancer.com
phabricator-0.freelancer.com
1.phabricator.freelancer.com
...
```

You can pass custom wordlists using the -w option. Currently, it uses words.txt taken from [here](https://github.com/haccer/altdns/blob/master/words.txt).
